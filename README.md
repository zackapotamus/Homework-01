# Code Refactor Assignment

This is an exercise in refactoring an existing codebase.

Websites need to consider how they are consumed by all people that might visit. It should strive to be accessible to all who visit.

Semantic html tags help to convey the structure and content of web pages in a way that they can be parsed by machines -- and thus used in technologies like screen readers.

I set out to modify the code in such a way that it does not change the display -- but still contains the semantic tags necessary to convey the structure.

I did this by changing or adding html tags, inserting attributes, and updating/consolidating the related CSS (and maybe fixing a bug or two along the way)

This assignment has helped me to give more thought to designing webpages -- making sure to keep in mind the multitude of ways visitors might need to interact -- and to make the page contents as consumable as possible to computers such as webcrawlers. These decisions should be considered early on in the design and development process to avoid (possibly costly) refactoring in the future.
